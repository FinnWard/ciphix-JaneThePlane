	- Ran into issue with managing where to run my weather API calls and troubleshooting them.
    	+ Initially looking through documentation on Typescript API calls and working through some examples without success in implementing this in my code I have resorted to looking up a dialog flow weather chatbot example.
	- Still figuring out exactly how to manage the context switches between the intents.
	- flight API's seem not to use flightnumbers that i am familiar with. might need to dumb it down and have userinput for flight departure and arrivals.

	- integrated a geofinder for locations so i can get lat and long info.
	- integrated new weather API that works with lat & long. this will allow me to also call weather information per minute/hour/day.
	- changed Get request handler from HTTP to axios to simplify code.

	- geoData API is whack, amsterdam is in japan and Tokio is in south africa apparently. 
	- International databases dont like dutch city names eg: parijs instead of paris. dialogflow automaticly provides dutch naming even if spelled in english way. 
		+ converted chatbot to english

	- Chatbot succeeds in console testing but fails in webdemo environment when i call weather information for a flight. i believe this would be due to 4 API calls needing to happen timing out.
		+ implemented async handeling of API's
	- chatbot geolocating was still terrible
		+ implemented GoogleMaps GeoAPI
