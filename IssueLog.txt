	- Ran into issue with managing where to run my weather API calls and troubleshooting them.
    	+ Initially looking through documentation on Typescript API calls and working through some examples without success in implementing this in my code I have resorted to looking up a dialog flow weather chatbot example.
	- Still figuring out exactly how to manage the context switches between the intents.
	- flight API's seem not to use flightnumbers that i am familiar with. might need to dumb it down and have userinput for flight departure and arrivals.

	- integrated a geofinder for locations so i can get lat and long info.
	- integrated new weather API that works with lat & long. this will allow me to also call weather information per minute/hour/day.
	- changed Get request handler from HTTP to axios to simplify code.
